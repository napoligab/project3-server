## Description

This is an app to create potential concerts and present them to the users so they can vote/fund for the concert to happen. The idea is that the app can reunite a minimum number of attendees/funds in order to close a deal with the artists and, in that way, connect them with their fans.

## User Stories

-  **404:** As a user I get to see a 404 page with a feedback message if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault.
-  **Signup:** As an anonymous user I can sign up on the platform so that I can have the user's features available.
-  **User Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can access my profile and start checking and voting/funding for concerts to happen and also be able to see the list of concerts I've voted/contributed for.
-  **Admin Login:** As a admin I can login to the platform and start creating and posting concerts.
-  **Logout:** As a logged in user and admin I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.
-  **User Profile Page**: As a logged in user I can visit my profile page so that I can access and edit it.
-  **Admin Profile Page**: As a logged in admin I can have access to the admin features, like creating, editing and deleting concerts, apart from editing my profile details.
-  **Edit Concerts:** As a logged in admin I can access the edit concerts page so that I can edit and delete the concerts I created.
-  **All Concerts Page:** A page where both user and admin can see a list of all concerts posted.
-  **Concert Details:** Both user and admin can have access to the concert details page so that they can check the status of the contributions and if the concert is happening or not.



## Backlog
